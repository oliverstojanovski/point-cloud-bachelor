'''
This function computes the optimal rigid transformation that best aligns two sets of data points. The transformation is calculated
in a weighted manner, where each point is associated with a weight, which should give each point a different importance. In this 
function, all the points have the same weight 1.

:param Matrix_A: matrix of dimension 3xN, this is the matrix of the target points, 3 for the three dimensions x, y and z and N points
:param Matrix_B: matrix of dimension 3xN this is the matrix of the source points, 3 for the three dimensions x, y and z and N points
:param weights: represents the weights of each point in the arrays A and B, which in this case will be 1

The function first centers both point clouds using wÂ´the weighted centroids. Then it computes the weighted covariance matrix.
This covariance matrix is than used in the Singular Value Decomposition in order to find the optimal rotation matrix.
Reflection is also taken into consideration
Based on the corrected rotation and centroids, a translation vector is calculated

:return: 
The functions return a 3x3 rotation Matrix R, which represents the optimal rotation and a 1x3 translation vector t, representing 
the optimal translation

    # So the importance is following:
    # 1. The subtraction moves the centroid to the origin of the coordinate system (0, 0, 0). This eases the geometric operations
    # such as rotation and scaling
    # 2. Centering both point clouds around their centroids creates a constant frame of reference making the alignment process easier
    # 3. It separates the translation from the alignment problem. Translational differences are isolated and finding the optimal
    # rotation in order to align the point clouds is easier

    # H = Am @ np.diag(weights) @ Bm.T

    # the multiplication with the diagonal matrix of the weights is unnecessary as it has the value 1

    # "Mareix_Bm" must be transposed as both matrix's are a 3xN matrix, so transposing "Matrix_B"m will make them compatible for
    # matrix multiplication
    # so instead of a 3xN * 3xN (which isn't possible), we now have a 3xN * Nx3 which will give us a 3x3 solution matrix
    # "Matrix_H" is a weighted covariance matrix which is needed in calculating the rotation between the two clouds
    # matrix_Am and matrix_Bm are the distances between each point and the center of mass of the two point clouds. They are needed,
    # so that we can align each center of mass to the center of the coordinate system(0,0,0). For example, if the center of mass has
    # the coordinates (3, 5, 7), and some point A has the coordinates (9, 7, 10), after aligning the point which is the center of the mass
    # with the origin of the coordinate system, the Point A has "new" coordinates which are (9-3, 7-5, 10-7) = (6, 2, 3)
